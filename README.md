# Countdown

Hi! I create this countdown as test for something that I was working. It is responsive and works only using CSS3, Vanilla JS and HTML5. :smiley:

## How to open

You have to clone this repository and after open the `countdown.html` file in your browser. It's going to be enough!

## How to start the countdown

Open the `countdown.html` file in a text editor and modify the date inside the JS code (line 102).
